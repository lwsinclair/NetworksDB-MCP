3. Configure the MCP Server
    ```bash
    "mcpServers": {
        "NetworksDB-MCP": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": [
                "<Your_Path>\\NetworksDB-MCP.py"
            ],
            "env": {
                "NETWORKSDB_API_KEY": "<Your_API_Key>"
            }
        }
    }
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Example queries you can ask through the MCP:

* "Find all information about IP 8.8.8.8"
* "Search for organizations named Google"
* "Get geolocation for IP 1.1.1.1"
* "Show me DNS records for example.com"
* "Find all networks owned by Microsoft"
* "Get reverse DNS for IP range 192.168.1.0/24"

Core commands:
- `key_info` - Get API key info and usage stats
- `ip_info` - Get IP address details
- `ip_geo` - Get IP geolocation
- `org_search` - Search organizations
- `org_info` - Get org details
- `org_networks` - List networks owned by org
- `asn_info` - Get ASN information
- `asn_networks` - List networks for ASN
- `dns` - Get DNS records
